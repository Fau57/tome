# Changelog

## 0.3.2 - 2025-05-09

### Fixes

- Fixes issue with deep link URLs. Turns out VSCode abuses them even more and uses no // in the scheme. So `tome:` instead of `tome://` for us. ðŸ™ƒ

## 0.3.1 - 2025-05-09

### Fixes

- Changed MCP Server deep link to conform to VSCode style urls, to support magic link installs via Smithery. New deep link URL format:
    - eg. `tome://mcp/install?{urlencoded-payload}`

## 0.3.0 - 2025-05-08

_Big Smithery integration to make using MCP even easier ðŸŽ‰_
